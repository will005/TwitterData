# Wrangling Twitter Data

  This was larger project involving 3 separate datasets containing twitter data from the "We Rate Dogs" account. One source a simple csv file. The other source was pulled using python's "requests" library, and last involved querying the Twitter API. 

  From here we assessed the datasets and aimed to combine the 3 into a master dataset for analysis. This involved both visual and programmtic assessment, cleaning, and finally analysis. We then wrote up the wrangling process and prepared a small blog-like report displaying our findings. 

This project was a part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree.
